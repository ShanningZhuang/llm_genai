# AI Big Models - Tsinghua University

This repository contains the course materials for the AI Big Models course at Tsinghua University.

## Instructor

This course is taught by Professor [Liu Yang](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1046/1204.htm) from the Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University.

## Course Description

This course is part of the AI capability improvement project for all graduate students at Tsinghua University, and is a limited elective course in the basic compulsory module. The teaching goal is to help students establish the concept and thinking of AI, systematically understand and master the basic knowledge and methods of AI big models, and cultivate "AI +" compound innovative talents.

The course will introduce AI big models from three aspects: basic theory, core algorithms and cutting-edge technologies. The main contents include: basic knowledge of AI, neural networks, optimization, attention mechanism, Transformer, self-supervised learning, GPT, instruction fine-tuning, tool learning, emergent ability, intelligent agent, multimodal big models, world models, embodied AI, evolutionary mechanism, etc.

The course adopts a teaching method of combining lectures with discussions and hands-on experiments to comprehensively improve the ability and literacy of students who choose the course in the application, innovation and management of AI big model technology.
